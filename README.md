## My Sieves

These are some sieves that I have written in C.
Currently multiThread.c one is only multithreaded for the presieve, and the segmented.c is not a segmented sieve yet.
So all in all everything is a work in progress, including the output format.

### prototypeSeg.c
This is where I test my latest thoughts and is currently the only active and up-to-date sieve. It employs omp multithreading and segmentation.

### multiThread.c OBSOLETE
Just the presieve is multithreaded, sorry. No plans to make this properly multithreaded.

### segmented.c OBSOLETE
Nothing yet. Will be a segmented sieve soon, hopefully.
